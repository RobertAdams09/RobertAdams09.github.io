## Project Goals
This project was the very first website that I have created so the main goal of it was to practice the HTML, CSS and Responsive Web Design skills that I have learnt recently. 
The website is an example of local enterprise website that promotes the company, shows off their work, team and provides contact information. Website is fully responsive with clear and managable layout.

## Built with
* HTML
* CSS
