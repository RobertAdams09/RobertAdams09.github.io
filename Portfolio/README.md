## Project Goals
This is my personal portfolio website that collects my best projects. The goal of this website was to once again practice all of the skills that I have acquired during learning how to code and most importantly to showcase my skills to the future employers and other people who are interested in programming. 
The website is fully responsive and works on all devices. It consists of links/buttons that will take you to the designeted website. It also consists of pictures and short videos in which I describe every project in more details.
